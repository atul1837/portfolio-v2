Developed a blockchain based decentralised warranty card distribution solution. Brands can signup up on our web app and generate NFT warranty card for consumers. User can store these warranty cards in their crypto wallets like Metamask. Brands can choose if these warranty cards are soulbound or they can be transfered to other users. These NFT based warranty cards can also be used to verify the authenticity of the product. These nft based warranty cards can also be used as proof of authenticity for high value goods like expensive sneakers.
